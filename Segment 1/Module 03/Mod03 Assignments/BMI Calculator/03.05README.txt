<+S>: I used static methods to make my code more readable. This helped to avoid documenting
    everything, as the method name makes it self explanatory.
I was able to use a method to round to a specific amount of decimal places that was roughly
    accurate.
Rather than using magic numbers for conversion factors, I made them variables so that it 
    made sense what they were.
I'm getting better at making my output look neat and clean.


<-S>: I had issues with really long doubles because of their decimal places, and it took a
    while to find a solution.

In the future: I will refer back to lessons, and do research to find the best ways to do 
things.
